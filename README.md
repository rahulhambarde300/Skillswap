# SkillSwap
SkillSwap is a one stop solution for those who need help and those who wants to help. Our site offers variety of features to enable the neighbours connect easily and find help within few clicks.

## Dependencies
There are number of dependencies used during the development of the site. The dependencies are as follows:
### NextJs
We developed the frontend for the SkillSwap using next Js. The NextJs is built on top of ReactJs. 

To start with NextJs you need to make sure that you have node installed in your machine. To install **Node** you need to run the following command.
```bash
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

#### To install NextJs:
```bash
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```


### Spring boot
The backend for the Skillswap was developed using Spring Boot, which is a Java framework.

To start a project in Spring you require Java Development Kit in your machine.
To install **JDK** run:
```bash
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install openjdk-17-jdk openjdk-17-jre
```

You also require **Maven** in the system to build the project. Run the following command to install maven.
```bash
sudo apt-get install maven
```

### External Dependencies
#### Frontend Dependencies 
- **Tailwind CSS** - To make the process of designing the page easier.
- **Openstreetmap Api** - To convert location to latitude and longitude
- **Upstash Redis** - To store chats
- **Pusher** - To get real time updates in chat

There are many other front end dependencies and all these can be installed with the following command:
```bash
cd skillswap-frontend
npm install
```
#### Backend Dependencies 
- **Mapstruct** - To simplify the implementation of mappings between Java beans.
- **Lombok** - To simplify the implementation of setters and getters.
- **Jacoco** - To analyze the code coverage.
- **JUnit & Mockito** - To write the test cases for the backend.

Each dependency will be installed when we build the backend project using Maven.
```bash
cd skillswap
mvn clean install
```

 
## Build Documentation
The build and deployment of the project involves several steps to be followed. The steps are provided in the documentation below.
### Build Backend
Once all the dependencies are installed we need to build the project. 
To build the backend run the following commands in the project source root.
```bash
cd skillswap
mvn clean package -Dactive.profile=prod
```

Once it is completed you will see `skillswap-backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` in your target directory. 

To build the docker image for the backend run the following commands from the source root.
```bash
cd skillswap
docker build -t <ImageName> -f Dockerfile .
```
Make sure to replace the `<ImageName>` with the name you want to give to your container. 

### Build Frontend

After installing the frontend dependencies using the node packet manager we can build the front end static files using the following command from the root of frontend:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will generate a dist directory that includes the static file that can be served with a server. We used npm's server to serve the static pages.

To build the docker 

### Deploying the project
To deploy the project we used `gitlabCI` to automate the process of build and deploy. To create your own `gitlabCI` you will require a `gitlab runner`. You can follow the Gitlab's official documentation to [install the gitlab runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/) on your system.

We included the following steps to build and deploy the project
-  **Test**: To run the test cases.
- **Build**: To build the backend package jar file.
- **Quality**:  To generate the code smells of the code using Designite Java.
- **Publish**: To push the docker image to docker hub
- **Deploy**: To deploy the application on the server.

Once your gitlab runner is ready, you can change the variables in the Gitlab's variables section inside pipeline settings.

Variables to update:
- **SERVER_IP** - The ipv4 address of the server where you want to deploy the application.
- **SERVER_USER** - The user inside the server.
- **DOCKER_USER** - The username on the docker hub where the images are stored.
- **DOCKER_PASSWORD** - The password for the user on docker hub.
- **ID_RSA** - This is a file that is generated to SSH in to the server.
- **IMAGE_NAME** - The name of the Backend docker image
- **FRONTEND_IMAGE_NAME** - The name of the frontend docker image.

After you configure these variables you can push you updated code to `main` branch and the pipeline will be activated and the site will be available on the server's ip address.
